# Tank Game

**Tank Game** is a small project I built in my free time using **Pygame**.  
The entire game runs from a single file — `tankgame.py` — and features two tanks battling it out in a randomly generated arena.

## Gameplay
- Two-player local battle (shared keyboard input)  
- Randomly generated obstacles each round  
- Basic projectile system (because squares shooting squares is surprisingly fun)  
- Simple but solid Pygame mechanics and collision logic

## Behind the Code
This project was my way of experimenting with:
- Pygame event handling  
- Random map generation  
- Basic physics and collision detection  
- Local multiplayer controls
